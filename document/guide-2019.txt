Hi all,
Please be aware that from this point forwards I want to try a new way of building sites. This new approach will allow you all to fully understand collections and the classes that power them, without getting held up with custom styles and simplifying the process of building sites.

So, started immediately can you start to use the new checklist titled “Collections Build” instead of “Full Collections Build”. From there you will only need to complete Steps 1 to 5. Your mentor or another member of the UK office will then work with the design team to:
1.	Style in any custom styles (not part of collections)
2.	Add animations – Working in collaboration with the Design team
3.	Device, browser, function and area tests
4.	Design Review

Your job will include:
1.	Initial design and build review
2.	Ui Kit
3.	Collections setup
4.	Asset creation


You will not be required to create any custom styles.

Also, the Photoshop files will highlight the areas of the design that are custom so you can concentrate on the collections.
